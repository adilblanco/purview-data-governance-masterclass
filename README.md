# Microsoft Purview Data Governance In-A-Day

> **Disclaimer:** This guide was created by [Olaf Wrieden](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olafwrieden) Data & AI Cloud Solution Architect, to collate guidance, information, and best practices to support conversations and workshops. It is tailored to assist you in starting a new Microsoft Purview Data Governance implementation from scratch. Organizations who have existing workloads and are looking to migrate to the new Purview experience may do so by following the supported migration paths, old concepts are however not covered by this guide.

## 🤷🏼 Purpose
This masterclass is designed to educate attendees on the end-to-end implementation of Microsoft Purview Data Governance in a "zero-to-hero"-style of approach. Assuming attendees know nothing about the service or functionality but have defined a set of data governance evaluation or implementation criteria.

At the end of this masterclass, participants will be equipped with a better understanding and functional knowledge to continue an implementation of data governance throughout their organization. This masterclass focuses on part conversation, part hands-on configuration in the Purview portal - with best practices and valuable take-aways throughout.

## 🧑🏼‍🎓 Audience
This masterclass is designed for: Data Stewards, Data Governance Managers, Domain/Business Owners, and Data Security Specialists who have a fundamental understanding of Data Governance and terminology.

## 📋 Attendee Pre-requisites
Each attendee should have access to the Purview portal at purview.microsoft.com and be granted permission to administer the data catalog (either temporarily or permanently) for the purpose of this workshop.
If interested in loading existing business glossaries, the attendee should bring their business glossaries in an Excel spreadsheet to be loaded into Purview.

## 🧑🏼‍🏫 Facilitator's Role
In addition to being a Purview expert, the facilitator's role is to facilitate an equal balance of productive discussion / discovery and Purview portal configuration progress. Timings per task are indicative only, and pace should be determined by the facilitator. The entire business data estate will not be fully curated at the end of this masterclass, rather, attendees will be equipped to continue the curation process themselves (due to time investment required).
