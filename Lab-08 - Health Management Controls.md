# Lab 8: Health Management Overview

**‚è∞ Duration:** 30 minutes

**üéØ Outcome:** At the end of this task you will understand the importance of data estate health and the tools provided by Purview to manage and maintain this.

## Introduction

Data estate health is the degree to which an organization's data assets are accurate, consistent, complete, accessible, secure, and compliant with business rules and regulations. Data estate health is a key factor for ensuring data quality, trust, and value for the organisation, across the data lifecycle.

In the age of AI, particular with [non-deterministic](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-ai-platform-blog/the-future-of-ai-the-paradigm-shifts-in-generative-ai-operations/ba-p/4254216#:~:text=However%2C%20generative%20AI%20introduces%20non%2Ddeterministic%20outputs) systems, it is imperative that we have accurate information about the health of our data to ensure that our models can provide the actionable insights grounded on reliable and trustworthy data. The Data truism of 'rubbish in, rubbish out' has never been more relevant. 

While organizations understand the need to have healthy data and the key requirements for achieving data health, its rare to find strong practices consistently implemented to deliver this.

The purpose of Purview's [Health Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/data-estate-health) capability is to provide customers with the tools they need to evaluate, take action, and report upon the health of their data. Given that data estates are growing rapidly managing the data itself is challenging enough, staying on top of data health often becomes a secondary objective.

Purview's Data Health Management capability has four components:
- Controls: [Controls](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/data-estate-health#controls) are a metric-based rules set at the global level, executed at the grain of the Governance domains. This enables the evaluation and audit of data health, aligned to industry and enterprise recognized standards.
- Data Quality: A set of [configurable processes](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/data-quality-overview#data-quality-features) which can provide data profiling, data quality scanning and scoring technical metadata, along with alerting into the Data Catalog. 
- Actions: Providing [actionable insight](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/data-estate-health-actions#available-actions) and notifications for steps you can take to improve data health and governance across your data estate. 
- Reports: A set of [out-of-box](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/data-health-reports#currently-available-reports) reporting supporting deeper analysis on the health of your data estate. 

By having this toolset available, focus can be placed on the need to have a more proactive and dedicated approach to improving data health and influencing decisions to actively improve it.

## Task 1: Understand the Health Management Controls

> Microsoft Purview Solution: Data Catalog

**‚è∞ Duration:** 15 minutes

**üéØ Outcome:** At the end of this task you will understand the 8 key pillars for data estate health. In Purview these can be considered the health [control groupings](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/how-to-health-controls#:~:text=Expand%20table-,Control%20grouping,-Control). All individual controls fall into one of these groups.


### What are the Key Pillars for Data Estate Health?

With Health controls you can define and measure the vital signs of your data estate across the eight key pillars of data estate health:

- Access and use: Do we have the right policies and procedures in place to facilitate access and compliant use of data? i.e. Do we have self-service data access policies in place? Are users declaring the intended use of the data?
- Discoverability: Are we enabling users to find the data they need? To what extent have we made data products available to our users with relevant data assets mapped?
- Estate Curation: Are data products suitably classified and labelled?
- Health Observability: Do we have the right tools in place to monitor the health of our data estate? Are they consistently used to drive better outcomes?
- Value Creation: Are data products aligned to business outcomes?
- Trusted Data: Do we know who owns the data? Has it been certified and quality checked?
- Metadata Quality Management: How well are the data products and assets described?
- Data Quality Management: What is the quality of our data in terms of accuracy, completeness, conformity, uniqueness, consistency and timeliness?
  

### Exercise: Review the Health Controls Dashboard

**ü´Ç Team Activity:** [15 minutes] Review the [available health controls](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/how-to-health-controls) and discuss the importance of each of health control within your organization.

**‚úçÔ∏è Do in Purview:** [15 minutes] Using the Health controls tool, navigate to the Health Controls dashboard and review the health controls available.

![Register data source button](./assets/health-control-dashboard.png)

Here you will see a summary of the Health Controls and the number of Controls that are in place. Initially there will not be any current scores displayed as these are calculated based on the current state Controls. Once the Controls are in place and the rules are defined, the scores will be calculated and displayed.

- Active controls: The number of controls that are currently in place.
- Not Healthy: The number of controls which are considered not healthy based on the health status rules that have been defined.
- Fair: The number of controls which are considered fair based on the health status rules that have been defined.
- Healthy: The number of controls which are considered healthy based on the health status rules that have been defined.
- Expired: A Control can expired when it is not being evaluated or is no longer needed because it is always green, which would be rare.
  - The control can be set to 'not active' which will expire it.¬†This happens in the Health Control edit panel by flipping the active switch at the top.</br>
  ***NB*** - This requires at least [Data Health owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/governance-roles-permissions#:~:text=Data%20catalog-,Data%20health%20owner,-Create%2C%20update%2C%20and) permissions.

Clicking on the arrow next to a Control Group, expands the list of Controls within that group. Click on a Control Name to view the details of the Control. This will show you a graph of the recent score, control description, health status, the linked  governance domain, the target value and when the control was created.

![Health Control Details](./assets/health-control-details.png)

**‚ú® Pro Tip:** The Health controls dashboard allows you to view your data estate health at a glance as a grid, a tree view or a chart view. You can also filter the controls by health status, Governance domain, owner or keyword.

## Task 3: Health control rules

> Microsoft Purview Solution: Data Catalog Health Management

**‚è∞ Duration:** 15 minutes

**üéØ Outcome:** At the end of this task you will understand how to configure Health Control rules.

Health Control rules measure the performance of each of your controls.

### Exercise: Review Health Control Rules

**‚úçÔ∏è Do in Purview:** [15 minutes]

Click on the Rules tab in the Edit control window to view the rules that are in place for the control.

![Register data source button](./assets/meta-data-quality-rules-default.png)

In this example shown in this screenshot is a rule for "Self-serve access enablement". This rule is defined as follows:

- Scope: The scope to which this rule should apply. In this case it applies to the Data product scope. The scope is determined by the type of rule that is being defined. (Highlighted in light blue)
- Rule name: The name of the rule. In this case the last rule is "Classification count of related data assets". (Highlighted in light purple)
- Comparison operator: When a comparison operator is relevant, it is defined here. In this case the comparison operator is "Greater than". Not all rules have comparison operators as in some cases it can be a binary rule. (Highlighted in light green)
- Value: The target value that the rule is compared against. In this case the value is 0. This means that the rule will be considered healthy if the number of published terms of use is greater than 0.

**ü´Ç Team Activity:** [15 minutes] Review the other rules available and discuss the importance of each of these rules within your organization. Consider the relevance and target values of each rule in your discussion.

**Permission Requirement:** To update and manage the control rules, you need to have the data health owner permissions assigned to you.

### Exercise: Update and Create Health Control Rules
