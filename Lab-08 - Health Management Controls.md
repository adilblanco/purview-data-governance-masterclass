# Lab 8: Health Management Overview

**‚è∞ Duration:** 30 minutes

**üéØ Outcome:** At the end of this task you will understand the importance of data estate health and the tools provided by Purview to manage data estate health.

## Introduction

Data estate health is the degree to which an organization's data assets are accurate, consistent, complete, accessible, secure, and compliant with business rules and regulations. Data estate health is a key factor for ensuring data quality, trust, and value across the data lifecycle.

In the age of AI , it is imperative that we have accurate information about the health of our data to ensure that our models can provide the most best insights grounded on reliable and trustworthy data.

While organizations understand the need to have healthy data and the key requirements for achieving data health, they very seldom have practices in place to evaluate the health of their estate.

The purpose of Health Management is Purview is to provide customers with the tools they need to evaluate the progress on their quest for healthy data. Given that data estates are growing rapidly managing the data itself is challenging enough, staying on top of data health is often treated as a secondary objective.

By having a toolset available which can quantify the health of the data estate, emphasis can be placed on the importance and need to have a more proactive and dedicated approach to improving data health and drive behavior and decisions to actively improve it.

## Task 1: Understand the Health Management Controls

> Microsoft Purview Solution: Data Data Catalog

**‚è∞ Duration:** 15 minutes

**üéØ Outcome:** At the end of this task you will understand the 8 key pillars for data estate health. In Purview these can be considered the health control groupings. All individual controls fall into one of these groups.

### What are the 8 Key Pillars for Data Estate Health?

With health controls you can define and measure the vital signs of your data across the 8 key pillars critical for the health of any data estate:

- Access and use

  Do we have the right policies and procedures in place to facilitate access and compliant use of data? I.e. Do we have self-service data access policies in place? Are users declaring the intended use of the data?

- Discoverability:

  Are we enabling users to find the data they need? To what extent have we made data products available to our users with relevant data assets mapped.

- Estate Curation

  Are data products suitably classified and labelled?

- Health Observability

  Do we have the right tools in place to monitor the health of our data estate?

- Value Creation

  Are data products aligned to business outcomes?

- Trusted Data

  Do we know who owns the data? Has it been certified and quality checked?

- Metadata Quality Management

  How well are the data products and assets described?

- Data Quality Management

  What is the quality of our data in terms of accuracy, completeness, conformity, uniqueness, consistency and timeliness?

### Exercise: Review the Health Controls Dashboard

**ü´Ç Team Activity:** [15 minutes] Review the [available health controls](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/how-to-health-controls) and discuss the importance of each of health control within your organization.

**‚úçÔ∏è Do in Purview:** [15 minutes] Using the Health controls tool, navigate to the Health Controls dashboard and review the health controls available.

![Register data source button](./assets/health-control-dashboard.png)

Here you will see a summary of the health controls and the number of controls that are in place. Initially there will not be any current scores displayed as these are calculated based on the controls that are in place and the rules that are defined. Once the controls are in place and the rules are defined, the scores will be calculated and displayed.

- Active controls: The number of controls that are currently in place
- Not Healthy: The number of controls which are considered not healthy based on the health status rules that have been defined.
- Fair: The number of controls which are considered fair based on the health status rules that have been defined.
- Healthy: The number of controls which are considered healthy based on the health status rules that have been defined.
- Expired: A control would be expired when it is not being evaluated or is no longer needed because it is always green, which would be rare.¬† The control can be set to not active which will make it expired.¬† This happens in the health control edit panel by flipping the active switch at the top.¬† This requires data health owner permissions.

Clicking on the arrow next to a control group, expands the list of controls within that group. Click on a control name to view the details of the control. This will show you a graph of the recent score, the control description, the health status, the owner, the business domain,the target value and when the control was created.

![Health Control Details](./assets/health-control-details.png)

**‚ú® Pro Tip:** The Health controls dashboard allows you to view your data estate health at a glance as a grid, a tree view or a chart view. You can also filter the controls by health status, Business domain, owner or keyword.

![Register data source button](./assets/meta-data-quality-rules-default.png)

In this example shown in this screenshot is the rule for "Self-serve access enablement". This rule is defined as follows:

- Scope: The scope to which this rule should apply. In this case it applies to the Data product scope. The scope is determined by the type of rule that is being defined. Highlighted in light blue.
- Rule name: The name of the rule. In this case the last rule is "Classification count of related data assets". Highlighted in light purple.

- Value: The target value that the rule is compared against. In this case the value is 0. This means that the rule will be considered healthy if the number of published terms of use is greater than 0.

**ü´Ç Team Activity:** [15 minutes] Review the other rules available and discuss the importance of each of these rules within your organization. Consider the relevance and target values of each rule in your discussion.
