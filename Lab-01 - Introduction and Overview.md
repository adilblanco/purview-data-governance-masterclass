# Lab 1: Introduction & Executive Overview

## Task 1: Opening Welcome & Introductions

**‚è∞ Duration:** 30 minutes

**üéØ Outcome:** Given we will be spending 8 or more hours together, let's get to know one another and learn your involvement in the data governance programme.

**ü´Ç Team Activity:**

1. Introduce yourselves: Your Name, Role in the organization, Personal definition of Data Governance.
2. Facilitator to introduce topic and agenda for the training.
3. "How did we get here?" - Share in a few words the current state of data governance in your organization and any maturity/readiness/technical challenges you have encountered.

To level-set the conversation, attempt to answer the following questions. Some answers may become clearer as you go through the training, but keep them in the back of your mind:

- Do you have a "data steward" in your organization? Who is it?
- Do you currently have a data catalog in place? How does it work? Is it effective?
- Is your organization subject to compliance obligations that require metadata to be stored in a specific region? If you have one, where is your data catalog located today?
- Do you already have E3/E5 Risk and Compliance policies in place (Information Protection / Sensitivity Labels, Insider Risk Management, Information Barriers etc)?
- Do you have an AI / Generative AI policy in place? If so, how do you manage data exposure risks?
- Are there any on-premises systems which should be cataloged as part of the data governance / cataloging initiative?
- Do you consume any critical third-party (external) data sources / APIs?
- Given data governance is interdisciplinary, have you considered use cases and identified stakeholders throughout the business?
- Have you figured out how data governance costs will be apportioned?
- Have you planned your path to production and do you have dates in mind for a data catalog go-live?
