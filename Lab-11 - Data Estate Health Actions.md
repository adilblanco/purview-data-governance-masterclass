# Lab 11: Data Estate Health Actions

**‚è∞ Duration:** 30 minutes

**üéØ Outcome:** At the end of this lab you will understand how to use Data Estate Health Actions to improve the overall health score of your data estate.

## Introduction

In the previous section Metadata quality, we looked at how to configure the rules that determine the quality score of each of your health controls. In this section we will focus on the Data Estate Health Actions in Purview and how to use it to improve the overall health score of your data estate.

The data estate health actions tool in Purview allows you to define and track the actions that need to be taken to improve the health of your data estate. These actions can be assigned to individuals or teams and tracked to completion.

**Permission Requirement:**

- You need data health reader permissions to be able to view Data Estate Health Actions.
- You need data health owner permissions to be able to update Data Estate Health Actions.

## Task 1: Understand the Health Actions Dashboard

> Microsoft Purview Solution: Data Data Catalog

**‚è∞ Duration:** 15 minutes

**üéØ Outcome:** At the end of this task you will understand how to use the health action tool to address the findings of the health control rules and improve data estate health by managing the steps required to complete the health actions.

### How are health actions determined?

Health actions are created when the health control rules are not met. Based on each specific health control rule, a health action is created to address the issue. The severity of the health action is determined by the severity of the health control rule as configured in the severity configration as discussed in the previous lab.

### The Health Actions Dashboard

The Health actions dashboard gives you an overview of the health actions that have been created based on the health control rules that have been defined. By default health actions are assigned to the

TO DO: Get answers from PG: . To whom are the actions assigned by default? Is it the business domain owner or the data product owner?  
Who are valid users that an action can be assigned to? Can you assign an action to anyone? Or do they need to have data estate health reader permissions to be assigned an action?

The Healt actions dashboard shows 4 tabs:

- Active: This shows new actions and actions which are currently in progress.
- In Progress: A list of actions of which the status has been changed to in progress.
- Resolved: A list of actions that have been resolved.
- My Items: Items assigned to you.

**‚úçÔ∏è Do in Purview:** [15 minutes] Using the Health actions tool, review the active health actions, assign an action to a user and set the status of an action to in progress.

Health actions can be filtered by the following criteria:

- Assigned user
