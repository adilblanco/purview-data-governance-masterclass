# Lab 10: Metadata Quality

**‚è∞ Duration:** 30 minutes

**üéØ Outcome:** At the end of this task you will understand the purpose and usage of the Metadata quality experience in Microsoft Purview Data Catalog.

## Introduction

In the previous section we discussed the importance of data estate health and the tools provided by Purview to manage data estate health. In this section we will focus on the Metadata quality experience in Purview and how to use it to configure the rules that determine the quality score of each of your health controls.

## Task 1: Understand the predefined logic for each of the metadata quality rules

> Microsoft Purview Solution: Data Data Catalog

**‚è∞ Duration:** 15 minutes

**üéØ Outcome:** At the end of this task you will have reviewed the predefined metadata quality rules.

### Exercise: Review Meta Data Quality Rules

**‚úçÔ∏è Do in Purview:** [15 minutes]

Using the Metadata quality tool, click on the first control group "Access and Use" and review the metadata quality rules that are in place for each of the controls.

The first rule, as shown in this screenshot is the rule for "Compliant data use". This rule is defined as follows:

- Scope: The scope to which this rule should apply. In this case it applies to the Data product scope. The scope is determined by the type of rule that is being defined.
- Rule name: The name of the rule. In this case the rule is "Published terms of use count".
- Comparison operator: When a comparison operator is relevant, it is defined here. In this case the comparison operator is "Greater than". Not all rules have comparison operators as in some cases it can be a binary rule.
- Value: The target value that the rule is compared against. In this case the value is 0. This means that the rule will be considered healthy if the number of published terms of use is greater than 0.

**ü´Ç Team Activity:** [15 minutes] Review the other rules available and discuss the importance of each of these rules within your organization. Consider the relevance and target values of each rule in your discussion.

**Permission Requirement:** To update and manage the metadata quality rules you need to have the data health owner permissions assigned to you.

## Task 2: Update and Create Metadata Quality Rules
